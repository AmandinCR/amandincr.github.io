								<h3 class="">Introductory Narrative</h3>
								<p>In this portfolio I poudly present the assignments and projects I have worked on in the past year for 
									IDEAS. My mindset on the ethical and social discussions that happen around science have greatly changed due to Thorson.
									I may not have realized it at the beginning of the first semester, but the diverse and supportive
									Thorson community was at the center of my freshman year at Colorado School of Mines. I met both of my 
									roommates through IDEAS and I got to see people similar to myself evolve and change while learning 
									about new views on topics we had never heard of before.
									I never thought I would be able to produce the art and abstract work that I have spent countless hours creating for Thorson.
									It's pretty amazing that every assignment had a new lesson or perspective to be learned based on ethical, social, and 
									technical understanding. As a homeschooled student, having such a close community of teachers and peers to reflect with 
									was a big change whose advantages I have now come to understand.
								</p>
								<h3 class="">IDEAS Mind Map</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Thorson_Mind_Map.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>As I explore in more detail in my Module 3 project, I am very interested in how the brain processes information 
									visual, audio, and other types of information. Some of the most important things I picked up throughout IDEAS is most 
									certainly the different perspectives I got to explore with my professors and peers through readings, writings, presentation, 
									videos, and other activities. There was also a clear theme/learning goal during each individual module. 
									I try to highlight this journey of collecting perspectives and trying to understand them 
									in my IDEAS mind map by sectioning different parts of the brain/functions to modules we went through in class.
									For context I will list the different brain sections and their purpose below.
							
								</p>

								<p>Frontal Lobe: plans and regulates emtions such as social skills</p>
								<p>Temporal Lobe: organizes memory and processes auditory information</p> 
								<p>Brain Stem: regulates heart activity and breathing, functions that are natural and instinctive</p> 
								<p>Partietal Lobe: deals with physical sensations and spatial judgement</p> 
								<p>Occipital Lobe: processes your eyesight including color, shape, distance</p> 
								<p>Cerebellum: controls balance and body co-ordination</p>

						<!-- Modules -->
							<article id="modules">
								<h2 class="major">Modules</h2>
								<h3 class="">Module 1</h3>
								<p>The first Thorson module was very important to me because I had a hard time expressing my feelings in 
									a way that other people could understand. I didn't consider writing as one of my strong points but 
									through the mentorship of Melanie Brandt and support of my peers, I learned how to dig deep into myself 
									and talk about my life. While revising this written piece I spent most of my time smoothing at sentences
									that did not flow well together. I decided to leave most of the original content because it helpes highlight
									the progress I have made during the past year.
								</p>
								<embed src="images/Module1.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="800px">
								&nbsp;&nbsp;

								<h3 class="">Module 2</h3>
								<p>In module 2 I felt much more at home due to the technical characteristic of the assignment. However, wicked 
									problems proved to be just as complicated as they sound. Dealing with a problem that has no intrinsic solution 
									due to the nature of the biases that surround it helped me understand the value of all-including research 
									(ethics, social/technical issues, economics, etc...). Not every problem can be solved by setting the homogeneous 
									equation to zero (differential equations reference). I had a hard time making revisions to this paper because it 
									is probably the piece I am most proud of writing in the first semester. I also smoothed out the overall structure and added a
									few sentences to help bridge the dsconnect between ethical and technical issues.
								</p>
								<embed src="images/Module2.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="800px">
								&nbsp;&nbsp;

								<h3 class="">Module 3</h3>
								<p>By the time I got to module 3, I had spent a lot of time reflecting on other people's biases/opinions 
									and felt ready to start presenting my own viewpoints to the world. I was very interested in the unique aspects 
									that makes the human brain so special and decided to work on a design manifesto that explored the automated 
									side of my thought process. Humans are not computers, but they way we approach problems is not so different.
									I represented my approach to problem solving through the machinery of the Turing machine, one of the first 
									computers ever built.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Module3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;
								
								<h3 class="">Module 4</h3>
								<p>The beginning of the second semester of Thorson enabled me to use all the skills I had learned from the 
									last three modules in one big project. It combined the writing, researching and presenting skills I had 
									been sharpening last semester but also included new aspects and challenges such as effective design 
									management using Sketchup (see <a href="#work">other work</a>). Collaborating with my team on this project 
									helped me improve methods of effective communication and compare my growth with other students in a positive 
									manner. The Executive summary was written by myself and so I spent most of my time making it look more like a
									summary rather than a paper of its own. I also included polished version of my team's background section.
								</p>
								<embed src="images/Module5.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="800px">
								&nbsp;&nbsp;
								
								<h3 class="">Module 5</h3>
								<p>In Module 5 I worked closely with Professor Terry Birdgman to generate art from a neural network that 
									was trained to recognize sunflowers from lilies. This module was similar to module 4 because we had the 
									opportunity to use all of the skills and perspectives we gained from the first semester in our 
									work/adventures. The main difference from Module 4 is that we were no longer working in teams. I learned 
									so much invaluable information from working on the module 4 group project, however, I still felt more 
									comfortable working by myself and had a blast reflecting on my work with Terry and my peers.
									Below is some of the pixel art I managed to create 
									through matrix/weight manipulations in python. The images to the left are the original images while 
									the images to the right are the ones generated by the code based on the network. I find it so cool 
									that we can basically see through the eyes of a computer AI by manipulating the generated data and 
									it into somewhat sensible art. Refer to the poster below if you are curious as to how these images 
									were created or don't understand the color code.
								</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Flower_network.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Here is another art peice I made after digging deeper into the evolution rate of my neural network.
									The model in the video starts very chaotic but as time goes on it starts to stabalize near an 
									equilibrium point. Also, if you want to understand the math/code behind this art please check out 
									my poster below as it contains all the information.
								</p>
								<video width="880" hieght="600" controls>
								<source src="images/network_evolution.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								</video>
								<p>This poster was made in LaTeX and proved to be a suprisingly difficult task. Balancing art and math 
									in the same space was very complicated because everytime I started talking about the mathematical model, 
									I wouldn't realized how technical the poster was getting. Even though it could use a few more revisions
									I am proud enough to present it to my IDEAS professors and peers.

						<!-- Other Work -->
							<article id="work">
								<h2 class="major">Other Work</h2>
								<p>Thorson provdied me with a class to pursue all the little questions about learning that 
									cluttered my mind. I have explored and prduced work through several different means, from 3d modeling 
									software to good old tracing paper. Here is some of my work that depicts my growth through this year 
									long experience.
								</p>
								
								<h3 class="">IJ pages</h3>
								<p>After one year of Thorson, I managed to fill up every single page of my IDEAS journal. Looking back on my 
									journal, I am very suprised with just how much variety is included. From interviews and drafts to 
									sketches and diagrams, I am very proud of how I filled out my IJ plan on keeping it for years to come. 
									I still vaguely remember some of the ideas I had as a kid and now that I have experienced having and 
									documenting with an IJ, I just wish I had started sooner.
								</p>
								<embed src="images/Journal_pages.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="800px">
								&nbsp;&nbsp;

								<h3 class="">Sketchup Progress</h3>
								<p>I spent a lot of time outside of class working on 3d models in sketchup. Even though I had 
									experince with 3d modeling softwares such as Cinema4D and Blender, learning to work with other 
									people on the same model was very eye opening. The Sketchup sessions and assignments made me feel 
									like I was working an actual job for a company with my progress shown below. The first picture is 
									the first assignment I completed in sketchup where I had to design my name. The second picture is a 
									mockup presentation booth I made for my Module 4 team project (see <a href="#modules">Modules</a>).

								<h3 class="">Miro Project-Drafting</h3>
								<p>During Module 4 I spent several weeks trying to understand a new wicked problem (Synthetic Biology). Miro 
									provided me with an intuitive tool for organizing information as I tried to build up a better picture of 
									the wicked problem.

						<!-- Conclusion -->
							<article id="closure">
								<h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>
								<h3 class="">Overview</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/water.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>IDEAS was quite the journey... As my professors have come to know of me, I try to put as much of my 
									work out there as possible. That being the case, I decided to present my IDEAS experience through a website 
									so that I could document my favorite memories. Whether that be the mistakes that led to growth or the overconfidence 
									that led to failure. Through intensive group discussions and interactive thought-provoking sessions,
									I learned the importance of viewing the world through different lenses. The instinctive and culutural values 
									that make up the communities around me have become gold mines for new ways of exploring the world. I came into 
									this class with a close minded understanding on the art of science and yet leaving with enough questions 
									to keep me busy for the rest of my undergraduate career. 
								</p>
								<h3 class="">Future Explorations</h3>
								<p>As a citizen of Thorson, I plan on treasuring the memorable times I had with my peers 
									(RiNo, The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, and Speed-Dating) and to keep working as 
									hard in all my classes as I did for IDEAS. My long term goal of working in an academic institution 
									has not changed since taking IDEAS but the class has showed me a new side of learning that I did not
									expect to be so useful. IDEAS was unlike any other class I took in my freshman year with its group discussions 
									and activities and yet it was just as effective, if not more, in most educational aspects. I plan on 
									using these newly aqquired collaboration skills from this unorthodox class structure in all of my classes,
									since the ability to work with others is a unique learning advantage and opportunity to gain perspectives like no other.
